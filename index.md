## Project 4: Starbucks Capstone

The Starbucks Capstone is an interesting project that seeks to determine which demographic groups respond best to different kinds of offers made by Starbucks. The project
comes with three datasets:

1. Portfolio Datata, which has information about the different kind of offers

2. Profile Data, which has demographic information of  clients

3. Transcript Data, which has the record of transactions, offers received, offers viewed and offers completed
 
The ultimate goal is to combine this three datasets and analyze the data in order to answer the question above. In this case, we develope a set of heuristics that help us
determine what offer best suits different types of customers.
