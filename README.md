# Project 4: Starbucks Capstone


## 1. Proyect Motivation

  Project 4 is the last project of the data cience Udacity Course. For this project I've chosen the Starbucks Capstone project. The goal is to analize the 
  data given by Starbucks and determine which demographic groups respond best to different offer types

## 2. File Description

  The file begins with the import of necessary libraries and a brief exploration of each datasets.Then a cleaning and preparing section, where each DataFrame 
  is transformed and prepared. Then we merge the three DataFrames and explore the final data. Lastly we determine  which demographic groups respond best to 
  different offer types 


## 3. Interaction with the Proyect

  Interaction with the proyect is simple. Running the libraries and uploading the datasets is necessary before starting to explore and clean the data. Each dataset
  has its own section.
